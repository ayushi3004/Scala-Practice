//A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects.
//For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits
//  1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations are listed numerically
//or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order.
//  The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:
//012   021   102   120   201   210
